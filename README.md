# WolfieMouse

WolfieMouse is a robotics project to build [a micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse). This project covers three parts:

* Robotics algorithm for maze solving (C++)
* low-level hardware driver software (C and ARM assembly)
* Tools to capture and plot robot's sensor data (Python)
* Embedded hardware design and PCB design (KiCad, an open-source alternative to Altium)

This robot won:
  * **The Special Mention Award in 2018 IEEE Region 1 Micromouse Robotics Competition**.
  * **The 3rd Place Award in 2019 IEEE Region 1 Micromouse Robotics Competition**.

## Get started

If you don't know what is micromouse competition, [this document will help.](doc/What-is-Micromouse.md).

Requires tools:
* [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) and [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) to build program for the robot.
* [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) to upload the program to the robot and to debug.
* [KiCad](http://kicad.org/) to design a PCB hardware.

Otherwise, a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machine environment is provided to skip installing the above tools.

If you whish to start with this project, see [get stared document](doc/Get-started.md).

## Documentation

See [documentation section.](doc/)

## Directory descriptions

* `doc`: Documentation folder
